            <p class="text-primary">Vehicle blindzone awareness is relevant to the safety of anyone interacting with a vehicle, whether they are in the driver's seat or outside. There are around 6,000 pedestrian deaths and 850 bicyclist deaths in the US every year, comprising about 19 percent of all traffic fatalities. An additional 123,000 injuries to pedestrians and bicyclists are caused per year by vehicles, and these numbers are continuing to rise <cite><a href = https://highways.dot.gov/safety/pedestrian-bicyclist> <bold>(https://highways.dot.gov/safety/pedestrian-bicyclist)</bold> </a></cite></p>
            <p class="text-primary">In 2017, the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center and Santos Family Foundation partnered with the <bold><a href="https://www.olin.edu/impact-research/scope">Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering SCOPE Capstone Program.</a></bold> The 2017-2018 SCOPE student team pioneered Project VIEW: Visibility in Elevated Wide Vehicles.</p>
            <p class="text-primary">With technological advancements and new partnerships over the past 5 years, there is increased demand for a robust assessment of the VIEW methodology to improve its capabilities for <strong>accuracy, efficiency, and ease of use.</strong> We explored several measurement methods to calculate blind zones of vehicles and selected a new methodology to implement on the VIEW website. We also evaluated the user experience of several aspects of the VIEW system, including the website and measurement process, to produce a completely redesigned website and data collection experience based on several rounds of user testing.</p>

            <p class="text-primary">To familiarize ourselves with the current project state, my team and I went through the site, vehicle measurement process, and data upload process. I primarily focused on the website UI and UX and conducted a site audit for all the screens and flows. Using best UX practices, I identified areas that were working well and what needed to be improved. Below are examples of some of the screens I audited. </p>

            <h5 class="font-weight-medium"></h5>
            <p class="text-primary">The key themes I identified across several pages were: </p>
            <ul class = "text-primary">
                <li>Inconsistent components across the site (header, disabled button use, visual language)</li>
                <li>Hierarchy is not very clear: order of information shown on page can be better utilized to retain users and decrease confusion</li>
                <li>Confusion caused by inaccurate labels in tabs and hyperlinks</li>
                <li>Lack of affordances to indicate what actions users can take (hover interactions, dropdown functionality)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-primary">As a team, we uploaded test measurements to mark up and noted the following difficulties: </p>
            <ul class = "text-primary">
                <li>Drawing on the photo is frustrating with a laptop and a mouse</li>
                <li>Instructions were confusing- unclear that we are supposed to mark 90 degrees to the right of the line until the last step</li>
                <li>No indication that the visualization and table are taking time to load, leaving us confused and thinking there is an error</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-primary">At this point, our team had become familiar with the current project state and had some ideas of the direction it could go in. However, we had some confusion on who the intended user group was, as conversations with our liasons indicated that they wanted VIEW 2.0 to have capabilities used by both professional researchers and everyday users. We needed to understand who the primary users would be in order to design a seamless experience that meets their needs. I lead a workshop with stakeholders at both Volpe and IIHS to identify our project vision and user groups.</p>

            <h5 class="font-weight-medium"></h5>
            <p class="text-primary">This workshop helped us identify 3 different groups of users who would be impacted by the VIEW 2.0 ecosystem. We wanted to focus on our Category 1 (Power users) and Category 2 (Everyday users) who would be interacting with the VIEW site and measurement process, whereas our Category 3 (Data users) would primarily only be looking at the visualizations and information produced from the site but not taking vehicle measurements. The key differences between our Category 1 and 2 users are:</p>
            <ul class = "text-primary">
                <li><strong>Power users: </strong>People who prioritize precise data from high-volume measurement,
                    even if the system has a higher barrier of entry. They will be using VIEW 2.0 to access measurement
                    instructions, upload data, and use the eraser tool to process the LiDAR scan. To support their needs, we
                    want to design a measurement process with high accuracy blindzone calculations. Ex. Volpe, IIHS</li>
                <li><strong>Non-power users: </strong>People who want an accessible tool for low-volume
                    measurement, such as for taking measurements of an existing fleet of vehicle(s). They may take their
                    own vehicle measurements and scans, or they will partner with power users to measure vehicles. To
                    support their needs, we want to prioritize a measurement process that can be done without specialized
                    tools and with minimal effort. Ex. City of Boston, NTSB</li>
            </ul>

        <ul class = "text-primary">
            <strong>Homepage didn't really convey site purpose and next steps: </strong>
                <ul>"I first thought this was an information site for a smartphone app until I went to FAQs"</ul>
                <ul>"My first thought when I saw the home page is a free smartphone-based tool, but where's the tool, how do I use it, I'm on a desktop website"</ul>
                <ul>"To be honest, I don't really understand what's happening"</ul>
                <ul>"I knew there was an app, but I didn't see the app anywhere"</ul>

        <ul class = "text-primary">
            <strong>Site seems outdated and visuals can be improved: </strong>
                <ul>“Carousel seems like it was created 10 years ago with the font and everything”</ul>
                <ul>“Overall, the site feels amateurish. It's confusing that there's an app and a table. Feels like it should be 2 separate things”</ul>
                <ul>“I would love to make this site a lot more beautiful”</ul>
                <ul>“This feel liks, oh, I feel like this was made in 2005 by the US government”</ul>
            </ul>

        <ul class = "text-primary">
            <strong>Information about direct vision is useful and should be in a more prominent place: </strong>

            <strong>Blind-zone visualization can be clearer: </strong>

                        <p class="text-primary">The original design I explored was to have one flow for the entire 'Add Vehicle' flow. Users will find measurement instructions, take measurements, upload data, and view results all in a step-by-step process after clicking 'Get Started'. 
                            However, we quickly pivoted from this design since the measurement instructions will be used outside at the vehicle, and based on what we had learned about the previous measurement process, a laptop was not usually brought out to the vehicle. Instead, users tended to print out the instructions and write down the measurements ouside, then return to their laptop to upload the data and view visualizations.</p>

                        <p class="text-primary">This table shows all the vehicle entries on the VIEW site. I wanted to ensure that there were just the right amount of search, filter, and sort by options to support users in quickly and easily finding the vehicle they are looking for. The previous site had around 480 vehicle entries, so we wanted to prepare the design for similar functionality and support.</p>
                        <p class="text-primary">I had learned during prior interviews that the old column names led to confusion, so one specific change I made was to use a 'View' button for the ingress to the vehicle visualizations. I also wanted to allow the option to open the visualization in a new tab to make it easy to compare vehicles, which was an important use case we had identified.</p>

                    <p class="text-primary">This page exists for each vehicle entry in the database that had successful processing. First, we take user input on driver height and what VRU's they would like to see blindzone visualizations for. We provide a to-scale diagram showing various VRU's and also have tooltips that provide additional information about Driver Height and VRU's.</p>
                    <p class="text-primary">Once they select all fields, the 'Visualize' button becomes active and the visualization is produced below. We provide key numbers in terms of how many VRU's are hidden in the blindzone and how far the nearest visible VRU stands. The diagram is color coded with a legend that shows the blindzones and visible areas. We specifically chose to emphasize the number of VRU's hidden in bold because we learned that it was impactful to users in further understanding how important direct vision is. </p>

                    <p class="text-primary">This alternative design has three main differences. First, we include an image of the vehicle from the LiDAR scan. Next, we do not have options for different driver heights. Lastly, we show different visualizations by using dots in the overhead view and adding a side and front view.</p>
                    <p class="text-primary">The vehicle image was not included in our final design due to technical limitations and privacy concerns if the licence plate were to be visible. With more time, we would have liked to find a way to include the vehicle image on the page so that users have an additional way to confirm they are viewing the intended vehicle.</p>
                    <p class="text-primary">We added additional driver height options because that was a strength of our new LiDAR method. With one vehicle scan and knowing the seat bounds, we were able to select any driver eye height to view blindzones for. We had considered having a custom input field to type in a specific height, but we decided that a similar impact in a simpler way would be achieved by adding 3 standardized eye heights.</p>
                    <p class="text-primary">The previous VIEW visualizations contained the front and side views. I created mockups for how it would look with a more modern diagram and more accurate VRU's, but due to technical and time limitations, we were unable to include it. We instead included bolded text that shows how close the nearest visible VRU is. </p>
